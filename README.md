#### An app that demonstrates how to achieve the scrolling tab bar effect as we see on uber eats.
#### It's not exactly like uber eats but very much similar to it.
#### It has some performance issues, but those can be fixed with some attention
#### Any improvements are heartily welcomed.
#### If you find any issues, don't forget to open an issue.
#### Please see the gif for the detail


#### You can use it at your need. I  would appreciate it if you star this repo if it helped you in any way
